**I haven't had your typical education.**

My high school education started in NYC at Stuyvesant HS, continued at Carolina Springs Academy in Due West, SC and ended with a self-paced program in Costa Rica. From a young age, I performed well with self study.

I completed my AA in a year and a half by taking extra classes and semesters, to speed things up.

Transferred to USF to complete my BA in Finance. Due to extenuating circumstances, I didn't complete it and moved back home. Bounced from university to university, but losing interest in the field.

Worked a string of jobs, not making enough money and draining myself both physically and mentally. I kept hearing about the tech industry. About coding. Data Science. Web Development. I read up on it and wanted to learn more. I didn't want to give up my job. I didn't think it was feasible. I kept thinking, ***"Should i do it?"*** and kept teeter-tottering.

> SO MANY OF US STRUGGLE WITH MAKING A DECISION BETWEEN TWO CHOICES. WE DON'T KNOW WHICH WAY TO GO IN FEAR OF NEVER KNOWING WHAT MIGHT OF HAPPEN IF WE CHOSE THE OTHER OPTION. IT'S TIME TO STOP LETTING THAT FEAR CONTROL YOU.
