## 9:00 AM - Start Time

#### Curriculum Review

I started my first day of bootcamp with **anxiety** and a shot of espresso.

As I logged on nervously, I wondered if I had squandered my last few days before bootcamp.

*"Did I practice enough?"*
*"Should I have read all the Ruby docs?"*
***Why did I leave 2 labs incomplete on the PRE-WORK???***

But as I read on, I saw that I had already finished **25%** of Week 1!
