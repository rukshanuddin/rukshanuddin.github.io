## 9:00 AM - Start Time

#### Curriculum Review

I started my first day of bootcamp with **anxiety** and a shot of espresso.

As I logged on nervously, I wondered if I had squandered my last few days before bootcamp.

*"Did I practice enough?"*
*"Should I have read all the Ruby docs?"*
***Why did I leave 2 labs incomplete on the PRE-WORK???***

But as I read on, I saw that I had already finished **25%** of Week 1!

*"I didn't even start yet!"*

My hard work paid off during the PREWORK! I was ahead of the game! I started working through the lessons and labs! If I was already 25% done, I could knock out the whole week in a day!

## 12:30 PM - Lunch Break

Going through the labs and reviewing what I had already learned, I saw that this is going to be an **intense** workload. The first lessons are basically reiterating what we have learned during the prework and are preparing. But what I thought was going to be a cake-walk, it is not. I need a break to rest my eyes, refuel... coding can be grueling.

I am grateful, I had gone the extra mile during the PREWORK, but anxiously awaiting what is in store...

***"Will I be able to handle the pace?"***

#### Not so bad!!
**I am getting in a nice flow.**
Going back on some things that was covered in the PREWORK, I was able to go and DRY up some of my code. I am already thinking of ways to become more effiecient and hopefully get more into the programming mindset. I definitely need to make a good plan and structure my time going into this to get the most I can out of bootcamp.

## 9:00 PM - Blog Time!

I am up to the **Prime? Lab**. I've spent too much time on it tonight, I know it'll come to me easily in the morning.

It's time to call it a night.

It was a great first day. I'm done with 70% of the weeks work. But I know that sometimes *10%* of the work can take ***longer*** than the other *90*! Time to do it all again tomorrow.

Excited for orientation tomorrow.

It is really time to change things.
